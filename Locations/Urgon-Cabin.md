Descriptions:

- [B3](../B-Mystery-in-Palebank-Village.md)
  > This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns. On the other side of the room, a small table strewn with dirty dishes and set with a dwarf-sized chair stands before two empty shelves whose contents are scattered across the floor: kitchen utensils, dried foodstuffs, adventuring gear, and a few books.

  - Any character who examines the mess in the cabin realizes that someone recently trashed the place while searching it. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the intruder’s footprints. [Tulgi Lutan](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) was the culprit, desperate for any clues that might help her cure the frigid woe that is killing her. Her tracks lead outside and back to her [cabin](./Tulgi-Cabin.md) 

  - Adventuring Equipment: [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s adventuring equipment consists of: 
    - a silvered maul
    - a suit of splint armor sized for a dwarf
    - bulky, fur-lined clothing sized for a dwarf
    - a grappling hook
    - a hooded lantern.
  
  - Mounted Head: A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes that the head mounted above the mantle belonged to a yeti, a monstrosity found in [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md).
  
  - Strange Receipt: A character who searches through the books on the shelf and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a folded receipt used as a bookmark. The receipt is dated two months previous, and indicates that [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) sold several Aeorian items found in [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md) to local antique shop [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Pelcs-Curiosities.md) for 1,000 gp. The items are listed as: 
    - a dagger
    - a scroll case
    - a jade statuette
    - a quiver of twenty arrows
    - a silver ring set with a jasper
    - two blue glass vials.
