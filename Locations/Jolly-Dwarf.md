## Developments

### Irven's Family

[Arl Bortock](../NPCs/Arl-Bortock.md) works behind the bar. If the characters ask for [Irven Liel](../NPCs/Irven-Liel.md), the dwarf points them toward the laughing family.

[Irven Liel](../NPCs/Irven-Liel.md), her husband Fenton Tethwick (both neutral good, Dwendalian human commoners), and their adopted daughters Honor and Magic (both tiefling noncombatants) are friendly and invite the characters to join them. [Irven](../NPCs/Irven-Liel.md) and Fenton are traveling booksellers. If asked about the vial, [Irven](../NPCs/Irven-Liel.md) explains that they met [Hulil Lutan](../NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) on the road to [Palebank Village](./Planebank-Village.md). She said she was moving and needed to shed some possessions, so she offered him a chance to buy the Aeorian relic at a great price. She plans to sell the item for a profit in Uthodurn.

If the characters tell [Irven](../NPCs/Irven-Liel.md) the truth about the vial, he panics, saying that everyone in her family has touched the object. Fenton gives the vial to the characters, handing it to them wrapped up in a cloth. Any character who touches the vial directly must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md).
