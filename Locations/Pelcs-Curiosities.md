Pelc’s Curiosities is an antique shop run by an introverted elf named [Verla Pelc](../NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md). [Verla](../NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md) keeps to herself, opening her shop only when the mood strikes her. She trades any and all objects that interest her, shipping them across Wildemount. Characters who are residents of [Palebank Village](./Planebank-Village.md) or have been there for a while know of Pelc’s Curiosities—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago. If the characters are recent arrivals to the village, anyone they ask about the shop mentions the robbery.

Pelc’s Curiosities is a one-story, two-room log cabin. The windows are shuttered and locked from inside, leaving the interior dark. The only entrance is the front door, but characters can force open one of the shutters around the back with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, granting access to [Verla](../NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md)’s quarters.

When the characters approach the cabin, read:

> The dark cabin before you has a sign over its door which reads, “Pelc’s Curiosities,” with the image of a curving dragon used to make the letter P. Though the shop appears closed, the front door is slightly ajar.

Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher hears whispered voices and footsteps coming from inside the cabin. If the characters succeed on a group DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check, they can surprise the bandits currently in the shop.

### Front Shop Area

The antique shop occupies the large front room of the cabin. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Five cloaked elves appear to have ransacked the shop and are searching through the broken debris on the floor. The furniture, shelves, and front counter have been smashed, and the shop’s wares now litter the floor.

This area is difficult terrain thanks to the debris covering it. The five elves are [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep.

The [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) attack as soon as they notice the characters, fighting until only one remains. That survivor then surrenders. If a captive bandit is questioned, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check can learn the following information:

- The [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) work for Hulil Lutan, a dwarf priestess of Tiamat. Hulil works for the Uttolot family of Shadycreek Run.
- Hulil’s sister, Tulgi, robbed Pelc’s Curiosities two months ago.
- Hulil is sick or cursed with some affliction that causes her to move slowly and is turning her veins blue.
- Hulil ordered the [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) to trash Pelc’s Curiosities in search of potions, scrolls, or other items that might help cure her. Despite their thorough search, the [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) found nothing useful. Hulil is hiding out with more [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) in Croaker Cave.

### Verla’s Quarters

[Verla](../NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md)’s quarters are at the back of the cabin. When the characters gain access to this area, read:

> What appears to be an ice statue of an elf is bundled beneath the blankets of a bed along the east wall of the room. A small table loaded with dirty teacups and a kettle stands next to the bed.

The figure in the bed is the unfortunate [Verla Pelc](../NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md), who was infected with frigid woe by Urgon Wenth’s Aeorian relics. Her symptoms appeared a few weeks after the shop was robbed, but the reclusive elf never told anyone about them.

### Development
Questioning any of the [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) can turn up solid leads that can take the characters to Croaker Cave, or back to Tulgi’s cabin if there are other questions the dwarf has yet to answer. If they were unable to question the [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md), you can have one of the [bandits](../Monsters/Bandit.md) carrying orders from Hulil that point toward the Croaker Cave hideout.
