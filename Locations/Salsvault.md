# Salsvault 

was once a laboratory in the city of Aeor, where mages who specialized in necromancy and transmutation magic crafted constructs and diseases to be weaponized against their enemies. Many of the laboratory’s creations remain active, still guarding the diseases and treasures within.

## Salsvault Features

The locations in Salsvault are detailed on map 5.10. Unless otherwise noted in an area’s description, the following features are common throughout all areas of Salsvault.

- Ceilings:
The ceilings in Salsvault’s rooms are 10 feet high, with 8-foot-high doorways connecting them.

- Chests:
Stone chests two feet on each side are built into the floors in several areas. A detect magic spell reveals a faint aura of abjuration magic radiating from each chest. A chest has AC 17; 27 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If an area’s description notes a locked chest, the chest’s lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools or forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength check. Ferol Sal (see area S17) carries a master key that locks or unlocks all chests in Salsvault.

- Doors and Walls
Salsvault’s heavy doors are made of black stone, and its walls are made of blue stone. A detect magic spell reveals a faint aura of abjuration magic radiating from the doors and walls. Each door and each 10-foot section of wall has AC 17; 27 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If an area’s description notes a locked door, the lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength check. Ferol Sal (see area S17) carries a master key that locks or unlocks all the doors in Salsvault.

- Aeorian Robes
The undead in the complex wear archaic-looking robes. With a successful DC 12 Intelligence (History) check, a character recognizes the robes as being of Aeorian style. The characters can also find intact robes of the same style in the complex. Constructs and zombies in the complex don’t attack a character wearing intact robes, unless the character attacks first.

- Eastern Slope
Salsvault is tilted in the ice, with its east side lower than its west side. Every area within the complex features a gentle slope downward to the east.

- Light
Unless otherwise noted, wall sconces with continual flame spells cast on them brightly light the interior of Salsvault.

- Temperature
Though Salsvault’s interior is guarded from wind and snow, the temperatures within the structure are still well below freezing.

- Water
Some areas of Salsvault are partially filled with seawater flowing in from beneath the ice of Thin Sheets. A creature that starts its turn in the frigid water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures that lair within the water in the complex are immune to this effect.

## Denizens of Salsvault
Many of the creatures the characters can encounter in Salsvault have similar characteristics and tactics.

- Beasts
Several sea creatures haunt the submerged areas of the complex. These beasts attack characters who enter the water, fighting until reduced to half their hit points or fewer before fleeing.

- Constructs
When Salsvault crashed into Foren, a number of its construct guardians survived. Those constructs continue to guard the complex, fighting intruders until they flee Salsvault. The constructs won’t leave the complex willingly and won’t pursue characters who do so. The constructs don’t attack the undead of Salsvault, understanding on some level that those undead are the remains of the people who created them.

- Undead
The humanoids working in Salsvault died when it crashed into Foren. Just before impact, Ferol Sal, the necromancer in charge of Salsvault, released an experimental disease that caused any humanoids who died in the complex to return as undead. Most of those affected returned as zombies that attack intruders on sight and fight to the death. Ferol returned as a wight and has continued to work obsessively in his personal lab (area S17) ever since. Because of the cold here, all the undead are relatively well preserved.

## Approaching Salsvault

As the characters approach Salsvault, read:

> Through wind-whipped snow and biting cold, you notice a half-submerged, dark-blue stone building poking up through the ice. A gray stone door is carved to look like a face with a half-exposed skull. Scribed above the door is the word “SALSVAULT.”

Ziro and Glacies, two [Ice Mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md), hide near the entrance to Salsvault, waiting for someone to open the door. A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notices the [mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md). If any characters interact with the [mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md), they attack in response. If the characters don’t notice the [mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md), the creatures follow them inside Salsvault, attracted to the [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) within. The first time the characters enter an area containing vials of [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md), the [mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md) seek out and break the vials, reveling in releasing the cold-based magical energy within.

## The dungeon
 
![Map](../Maps/5.10-salsvault.png)
### (S00) Sealed Entrance

The entrance to Salsvault is frozen shut. The characters can force the door open with a successful DC 15 Strength check or by dealing 10 bludgeoning or fire damage to the ice that seals the door. Unsealing the door with bludgeoning damage draws the attention of two suits of animated armor in area S3, which gather in area S1 and attack the characters as soon as they enter.

###  (S01) Entrance Chamber

> The heavy stone walls of this room dampen the cold and the howling wind outside. An inscription in what looks like Draconic runes is carved into the east wall.

The inscription is in an archaic version of Draconic that was spoken in ancient Aeor. It can be read by any character who can read Draconic with a few minutes of study, or by anyone with access to a comprehend languages spell or similar magic. The message reads: “Welcome to Salsvault! Visitors, please wait here for an escort, and DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING WITHOUT PERMISSION.”

If the characters make any noise louder than a whisper in this chamber, the suits of animated armor in area S3 come to investigate.

- Locked Door
The door that leads to area S4 is locked

- Open Door
The door that leads to area S2 is slightly ajar. A character who examines the door and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check notes that it was recently forced open (by [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) and [Orvo](../NPCs/Orvo-Mustave.md) when they explored Salsvault).

### (S02) Ransacked Frigid Woe Laboratory
> Stone tables lie in pieces on the floor at the east end of the room. Two open stone chests stand against the west wall. A layer of fine sand coats the inside of the chests and the floor around them.

If the characters make any noise louder than a whisper in this chamber, the suits of animated armor in area S3 investigate the noise.

Any examination of the chests reveals that they are built into the floor. A character who examines the sand on the ground near the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices two sets of dwarf-sized boot prints (from [Orvo](../NPCs/Orvo-Mustave.md) and [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)) as well as two sets of boot prints made by human-sized feet (the animated armor from area S3).

### (S03) Animated Armor Laboratory

> Pieces of rusty plate armor are scattered about this chamber amid the rubble of destroyed stone furniture. An anvil built into the floor stands in front of a cold furnace to the southwest. Across the room from the furnace, two humanoid feet stick out from a pile of rubble.

Two suits of [animated armor](../Monsters/Animated-Armor.md) normally stand guard in this chamber. If the armor didn’t leave to investigate disturbances in areas S1 or S2, both suits are here when the characters arrive, and you can add the following:

> Two full suits of steel armor stand upright but empty in the middle of the chamber, their gleaming surfaces a stark contrast to the rusty pieces lying nearby.

#### Rescue Mission
One of the blacksmiths who worked in this chamber was crushed by a stone table that broke into rubble when Salsvault crashed into Foren. Since then, the blacksmith has been a zombie restrained beneath the rubble and unable to break free. Any character who examines the feet notices them twitching with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the characters want to help the “victim” under the rubble, one character can remove enough rubble to free the zombie in 10 minutes. Multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. As soon as it is freed, the zombie attacks.

Treasure
The zombie wears an apron containing a set of damaged mithral smith’s tools (worth 50 gp).

### (S04) Frigid Woe Laboratory

> Smashed stone tables litter the floor in this chamber. Two stone chests built into the floor stand next to each other along the far wall. A door to the west is inscribed with words in Draconic runes. A large iron lever is flipped into the up position on the wall next to the door.

#### The inscription in archaic Draconic reads: 
“Disease storage. Authorized personnel only.”

#### Chests
These stone chests are locked and magically trapped. When a creature makes a failed attempt to pick the chest’s lock, or attacks or attempts to force the chest open, the chest shoots a beam of cold energy at the creature. The beam is +4 to hit and deals (1d8) cold damage on a hit.

A character who searches the exterior of either chest and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check finds an archaic Draconic word for “ice” carved in tiny letters near the hinges. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character senses that the inscription is connected to a trap. Scratching out the inscription with a tool or a weapon causes the trap to stop functioning on that chest.

Each chest is packed with fine sand, within which are nestled two vials of frigid woe 

#### Iron Lever
A character who examines the lever notices spots of faded red paint on it with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. As an action, a creature can pull the lever down, causing flames to shoot down from the ceiling in area S5. Even with the door closed, a hiss can be heard in this area when the flames are active. A creature can use an action to push the lever back up, which shuts off the flames. See area S5 for more information on this hazard.

#### Locked Doors
The doors from this area to areas S1 and S5 are locked. The door to area S5 is also trapped.

#### Trapped Door
A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic radiating from the locked door to area S5. When a creature makes a failed attempt to pick the door’s lock, or attacks or attempts to force the door open, that creature is teleported into the middle of area S15.

A character who searches the door and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds an archaic Draconic word for “disappear” carved in tiny letters near the foot of the door on both sides. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character senses that the inscription is connected to a trap. Scratching out either inscription with a tool or a weapon causes the trap to stop functioning.

### (S05) Disease Storage

If the iron lever in area S4 has been raised, read the following when the door to this room is opened:

> A wave of heat hits you from the wall of roiling flame that fills this area, shooting down from the ceiling.

If the flames are off, read:

> The only things to be seen in this room are eight chests built into the floor along the far wall.

If the flames are active, each creature that enters this area or starts its turn there must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking (1d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the flames aren’t active, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notes a faint oily smell in the room and notices pin-sized holes covering the ceiling.

Chests
Each chest is locked, packed with fine sand, and contains three vials of frigid woe 


### (S06) North Hall

Three human [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) in tattered Aeorian robes roam this hall aimlessly and attack intruders on sight.

### (S07) Unoccupied Dorm
> Four unmade beds are built into the east and west walls here, each with a footlocker tucked beneath it.

One of the footlockers holds an intact Aeorian robe

### (S08) Ruined Dorm

Salsvault’s crash into Foren destroyed the magic torches in this room, leaving it shrouded in darkness. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Debris from broken stone furniture covers the floor. The walls here are cracked, as if they once supported built-in shelves that have been reduced to rubble.

The floor of this chamber is covered in rubble, making it difficult terrain. A rug of smothering is hidden beneath the rubble. A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notices the rug, but gets no hint that it is animated.

A search of the rubble and a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check turns up an intact Aeorian robe.

### (S09) Zombie Dorm
When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Footlockers are tucked beneath four beds attached to the north and south walls. In the middle of the room, four [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) in tattered robes shuffle around, softly knocking into one another without caring.

The four [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) attack as soon as they see intruders. The footlockers are empty.

### (S10) Ferol Sal’s Chamber

The door to Ferol Sal’s personal quarters is locked. When the characters can see this area, read:

> This room is in immaculate condition, apparently having been cleaned up after the destruction seen elsewhere in the complex. A crisply made bed stands at the center of the west wall, with small tables off to either side. The room also contains a stone desk set with a chair, and a chest built into the floor.


Though the undead Ferol no longer sleeps here, he and the zombies tidied up his personal space after Salsvault crashed into [Eiselcross](./Eiselcross.md).

#### Chest
The chest contains Ferol’s treasure, along with a [swarm of undead snakes](../Monsters/Swarm-of-Undead-Snakes.md) that attacks any creature that opens the chest. 

The chest contains: 
- 1,000 sp
- 45 ep
- 200 gp in Aeorian coinage.

#### Desk
Any search of the desk turns up a bottle of dried ink, several used quills, five sheets of blank parchment, and a piece of paper with a faded message written on it in archaic Draconic. A character who understands Draconic can spend a few minutes to piece together the meaning of the note, or it can be deciphered with a comprehend languages spell or similar magic. The note reads:

> To whomever finds this:

All my people are dead: my family, my friends, and my workers. I, too, am dead. Were it not for my quick thinking and prowess with necromancy, our important work at Salsvault would be over. I continue to labor in my undead form, trying to find a sickness that can infect the gods themselves. If I have perished, I implore you to find my lab, find my notes, and finish my work. The gods must pay for Aeor’s destruction.

—Ferol Sal



### (S11) Kitchen

Salsvault’s crash into Foren destroyed the magic torches in this room, leaving it shrouded in darkness. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Iron pots, pans, utensils, and frost-covered food covers the floor of this kitchen. A steel stove is built into the west wall. Old frozen cheese, bread, meat, and produce cover the floor, all well rimed and inedible.

When the characters enter the room, four [animated kitchen knives](../Monsters/Animted-Knife.md) fly up from the floor and attack.


### (S12) Dining Hall

> The remains of broken tables and chairs are piled along the east wall. Two human [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) in tattered robes shuffle aimlessly around each other at the center of the chamber.

The two [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) occupying the dining hall attack any intruders. All the other features of this room have been reduced to rubble.


### (S13) Drowned Library

> Water ebbs and flows through a large opening along the east wall of this ruined library. Rotting parchments and waterlogged tomes are spread everywhere, fallen from cracked stone shelves.


The water is deeper than it appears beneath the ruined books and parchments, with the floor along the eastern side of the room having collapsed to a depth of 15 feet. A [giant octopus](../Monsters/Giant-Octopus-Card.PNG) hides here, having claimed this room as its lair. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by the octopus’s Dexterity (Stealth) check notices the beast. 

### Treasure
A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher, or one who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notices a watertight scroll case floating in the water. The case holds two spell scrolls of detect magic.

### (S14) South Hall
Three well-preserved human [zombies](../Monsters/Zombie.md) in tattered robes roam this hall aimlessly, attacking any intruders that catch their attention.



### (S15)  Animated Weapon Storage

The door to this room is locked. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Broken blades, cracked hammers, frost-rotted spears, and other ruined weapons are spread out across the floor, fallen from the empty iron weapon racks that line the walls.

The mages of Salsvault stored animated weapons in this room, most of which were destroyed in the crash. Five [flying swords](../Monsters/Flying-Sword-Card.PNG) lay among the debris, attacking any characters who enter.

The broken weapons on the floor make this area difficult terrain. Any creature that falls prone in this room takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage.


### (S16) Golem Laboratory

As the characters approach this room, read:

> A large red X is painted across the stone door before you. Violent banging and the sound of heavy objects being tossed around emanates from the chamber beyond.

The door is locked. If the characters open it, read:

> As you open the door to this debris-filled room, a humanoid creature made of pieces of stitched-together flesh charges toward you. The monster’s body is covered in wounds, and broken pieces of bone stick through its skin at odd angles.

When Salsvault crashed into Foren, this [golem](../Monsters/Damaged-Flesh-Golem-Card.PNG) servant of the mages was driven mad from the damage it took. Ferol locked the [golem](../Monsters/Damaged-Flesh-Golem-Card.PNG) in this room ages ago. The [golem](../Monsters/Damaged-Flesh-Golem-Card.PNG) uses the flesh [golem](../Monsters/Damaged-Flesh-Golem-Card.PNG) stat block, with these changes:

#### Debris
The [golem](../Monsters/Damaged-Flesh-Golem-Card.PNG) has long since smashed all the objects in this chamber not destroyed by Salsvault’s crash. Any search of the debris turns up only bits of bone, clay, iron, stone, and paper.


### (S17) Ferol’s Laboratory

> Six long stone tables are set with steel and glass laboratory equipment in this chamber, whose walls are lined with shelves holding all manner of strange knickknacks and tools. An armed humanoid with white skin and red eyes moves from table to table, adjusting bubbling mixtures and carefully adding reagents.

#### Shelves
The shelves hold spell components, reagents, and laboratory supplies that are far past their prime. However, a character who spends a few minutes searching the shelves can collect enough workable tools and reagents to put together a set of alchemist’s supplies.

#### Tables
Each table holds a working set of alchemist’s supplies that Ferol uses to experiment with [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md). If a creature is forcibly moved into a table, the delicate equipment on that table breaks and the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md).




### (S18) Drowned Curative Laboratory

> A cold wind howls through the collapsed east wall of this huge chamber, whose far side is completely submerged under frigid seawater. A dense bed of kelp grows up from the submerged floor, obscuring any sight of what lies below. Broken glass and the remains of shattered tables cover the floor in the dry section of the room.

Aeorian mages worked in this chamber to ensure that they could cure the diseases they created.
Four giant crabs now lair here, hiding beneath the kelp in the 5-foot-deep water and attacking any creatures that intrude.
A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notices the crabs, which attack with surprise if not spotted.
The kelp makes the water difficult terrain for creatures other than the giant crabs.

#### Chest
A character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher notices a stone chest built into the floor and submerged in the water against the back wall. The chest is locked 

The chest is packed with fine sand and contains twenty doses of frigid woe antidote and an ersatz eye.
