The characters are welcome to this yurt during their time in [Syrinlya](./Syrinlya.md). When they first enter, read:

> The sound of wind and the biting cold die down as you enter the yurt. A cold fire pit marks the center of the hide-covered floor. An open crate containing packaged rations and a few other items stands next to the door.

The crate contains: 
- 50 days of rations
- 50-foot silk rope
- blanket
- grappling hook
- miner’s pick
