When the characters approach read:

- [B4](../B-Mystery-in-Palebank-Village.md)
  > This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke piping out of the chimney indicates a roaring fire within.

  [Tulgi Lutan](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md)’s home is a one-story, one-room log cabin. Because she isn’t keen on letting the characters in, the following features might be important:

  - The roof of the cabin is 12 feet high. Climbing up the outside walls requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
  - The wooden door to the cabin is locked and has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. [Tulgi](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) carries the key that unlocks the door.
  - Each of the cabin’s four walls has one window, which is shuttered and latched from the inside. A window can be unlatched from outside with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
  - The inside of the cabin is brightly lit by fires in a brazier and a fireplace, though the smoky haze given off by both makes the interior lightly obscured.

  If the characters knock on the door, [Tulgi Lutan](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf thug with a walking speed of 10 feet) calls from the other side, telling them to go away. A character who shouts back through the door and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check convinces [Tulgi](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) to open the door and allow the party inside. Otherwise, she ignores anything the characters say.

  If the characters aren’t invited inside, they’ll have to decide what other means they’re willing to use to enter. Regardless of how they do so, when the characters enter the cabin, read:

  > The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze. Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands.

  If the characters broke into the cabin, [Tulgi](../NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) attacks as soon as she sees them, fighting until reduced to 10 hit points, then surrendering. She has two pet [wolves](../Monsters/Wolf.md), Iro and Jira, that hide beneath her bed. If a fight breaks out, the [wolves](../Monsters/Wolf.md) join the fray to defend her.
