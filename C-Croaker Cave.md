# Croaker Cave (C)

Characters local to [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) or who have spent some time there know [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md). If all the characters are new arrivals to the village, any of the villagers can tell them about the cave and how to get there.

[Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md) gets its name from its resident [giant ice frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md). Its entrance is on the shores of the Frigid Depths, due north of [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md). As the characters draw close to the cave entrance, they see frequent signs of tracks where [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) have been coming and going. However, there are no signs of patrols or guards. A plume of smoke rises from the ground beyond the cave entrance, venting through a narrow natural chimney from area C6. The chimney is too small to be climbed, however, and the main cave entrance is the only entry point.

Knowing that the residents of [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) avoid the cave and its dangerous [frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md), [Hulil Lutan](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) has made the place her base of operations. She and the [Uttolot bandits](./Factions/Uttolots.md) she commands have domesticated the [giant ice frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) that make the cave their home, using them as guard animals.

## Giant Ice Frogs

With the exception of Old Croaker (see area C5), giant ice frogs are giant frogs with immunity to cold damage.

The blue-skinned frogs attack any creatures in the cave complex not escorted by [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) they recognize. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check as an action convinces one [frog](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) to not attack or to stop attacking. If the character or any of their allies attacks or harms the [frog](./Monsters/Bandit.md), it resumes combat.

The [frogs](./Monsters/Bandit.md) spend much of their time resting in pools of murky, frigid water in [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md). A character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by a frog’s Dexterity (Stealth) check notices a frog hiding in a pool. If a [frog](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) goes undetected, it attacks with surprise when a character comes within 5 feet of the pool.

## Uttolot Bandits

The [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) sent out with [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) by the [Uttolot family](./Factions/Uttolots.md) are all dwarves and elves. Up to ten [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) normally occupy [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md), but only three are currently present (in area C2). They use the [bandit](./Monsters/Bandit.md) stat block and have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, the dwarves have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison; the elves have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep

[Uttolot](./Factions/Uttolots.md) [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) attack any intruders on sight. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees the caves. If the characters capture an [Uttolot](./Factions/Uttolots.md) [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md), they can learn the following information with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check:

- [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) is sick with the same malady that killed [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs//Urgon-Wenth.md).
- [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) plans on setting out for [Shadycreek Run](./Locations/Shadycreek-Run.md) soon, hoping that trading the items her sister [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) stole from [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) allows her to pay for healing that will cure her.

## Croaker Cave Features

The caverns and tunnels of the [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md) complex are shown on map 5.9. Unless otherwise noted in an area’s description, the following features are common throughout all areas of [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md).

- Ceilings: Cavern ceilings are 10 feet high, with only 8 feet of clearance beneath stalactites.

- Walls: Climbing the rough walls of a cavern requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.

- Light: The caverns contain no light sources, except in area C6, as the inhabitants of Croaker Cave rely on darkvision to see.

- Frigid Pools: Pools of murky, frigid water within the caverns are created by melting snow on the rocky ground above dripping down through the ceiling. Each pool is 10 feet deep. A creature completely submerged in a pool must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on this saving throw. For each minute the creature spends submerged in a pool, it must repeat this saving throw, gaining another level of exhaustion on a failure.

## Entrance Pool (C1)

This area of the cave is close enough to the entrance that it is dimly lit by day and on clear moonlit nights. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> The slow dripping of water sounds out where it falls from stalactites down into a murky pool that fills the rough tunnel ahead. Every few moments, a loud croaking sounds out from somewhere in the darkness beyond.

With darkvision or an appropriate light source, the characters can see a 25-foot-long heavy wooden beam lying against the west wall of the cave at the south end the pool. The [Uttolot](./Factions/Uttolots.md) [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) use the beam to cross the pool, and pull it back to the far side when they are in the cave.

Two [giant ice frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) hide in the murky pool. If combat breaks out in this area, the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) in area C2 quickly come to investigate.

## Entrance Pool (C2)

> The slow dripping of water from the ceiling flows to a pool in the southwest corner of this cavern. A large wooden bucket with a lid sits near the edge of the pool.

Three [Uttolot](./Factions/Uttolots.md) [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) and two [giant ice frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) normally occupy this cavern. If the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) have not yet been alerted to disturbances, they are training the frogs. Add the following:

> A dwarf and two elves bundled in layers of winter clothing are throwing dead bats into the air. Two giant blue-skinned frogs leap up to snatch the bats in midair, seemingly as part of some sort of training session.

If the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) went to investigate disturbances in adjacent areas, the [frogs](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) are hiding in the pool.

### Bucket

The bucket holds six dead bats used as training treats. A character who offers a dead bat to a [frog](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) has advantage on their next Wisdom (Animal Handling) check made to control that [frog’s](./Monsters/Giant-Frog.md) behavior.

## Bat Cavern (C3)

> This cavern reeks, and its floor is covered in bat guano.

A [swarm of bats](./Monsters/Swarm-of-Bats.md) sleeps among the stalactites in this cavern. If anything disturbs the [bats](./Monsters/Swarm-of-Bats.md) (including a light source or a loud noise in the cavern), the [swarm](./Monsters/Swarm-of-Bats.md) attacks the source of the disturbance. The [swarm](./Monsters/Swarm-of-Bats.md) fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees out of the cave complex. If combat breaks out in this area, the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) in area C2 come to investigate.

## Bandit Camp (C4)

> Ten empty bedrolls are arranged in a circle around a cold fire pit at the center of this cavern. Chicken bones, empty wine and spirits bottles, and other food waste litters the floor.

One of the bedrolls covers the opening of a 10-foot-deep pit trap. The trap can be spotted with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If not spotted, anyone walking across the bedroll falls into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. A creature that falls into the pit makes enough noise that the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) in area C2 investigate

### Treasure

Searching all the bedrolls reveals that one contains an unopened bottle of Bald Dwarf Whisky (worth 25 gp), an alcohol made by elves in Uthodurn.

## Old Croaker’s Pool (C5)

> Water dripping down from stalactites in the ceiling fills a dark pool that completely covers the floor of this cavern.

Croaker Cave’s largest denizen—named [Old Croaker](./Monsters/Giant-Toad.md) by the Uttolot bandits—has claimed this pool. It hides in the water and attacks as other giant ice frogs. [Old Croaker](./Monsters/Giant-Toad.md) is a giant toad with immunity to cold damage.

[Old Croaker](./Monsters/Giant-Toad.md) has been trained to ferry [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) and visitors to her cavern (area C6) across the pool. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to convince [Old Croaker](./Monsters/Giant-Toad.md) to not attack the party can also convince the frog to ferry all the characters across the pool one at a time.

## Hulil’s Cavern (C6)

When the characters can see into this area, read:

> A warm rush of heat comes from a massive fire burning in the center of this cavern, its smoke venting up through a narrow stone chimney. The flames illuminate a rough painting of a five-headed dragon that dominates the north wall. A bedroll is spread out beneath the mural. Near the crackling blaze, a dwarf bundled in a heavy cloak sits on a stone chest beside an elf whose face is covered in dragon tattoos. The dwarf’s face is streaked with pulsing blue veins.

[Hulil Lutan](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf cult fanatic with a walking speed of 15 feet, darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison) and her apprentice, Raegrin Mau (a neutral evil, male wood elf cultist with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and immunity to magic that would put him to sleep), are both in a state of deep meditation, praying to Tiamat for a cure for the dwarf’s affliction. Even if combat broke out in area C5, they remain unaware of the characters’ presence until they are disturbed or attacked. Hulil and Raegrin are both greedy servants of Tiamat and the Uttolot family. Raegrin follows Hulil’s every order with unshaking loyalty.

[Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) is so desperate for a cure for the ailment that is slowly killing her that she doesn’t attack the characters when she first sees them, as long as she isn’t attacked first. Instead, she orders them to stand down and demands to know why they came to the cave. A quick-thinking character can claim to have come to help [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  (at the direction of her sister, after receiving a message from Tiamat, or with another appropriate rationale). With a successful Charisma (Deception) check opposed by [Hulil’s](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  Wisdom (Insight) check, the character convinces the dwarf that all the characters are her allies. On a failed check, or if the characters challenge her, [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  and Raegrin attack.

### Campfire 
Any creature that enters the area of the fire for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there, takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

### What Hulil Knows
If the characters convince [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  that they are her allies, or if they capture her or Raegrin and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they can learn the following information:

[Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  believes she has a disease called [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md). Though she doesn’t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she’s heard rumors that explorers in [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) sometimes succumb to it.
[Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) stole from [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md), originally sold by [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md). The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely color was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior.
She is desperate to get to [Shadycreek Run](./Locations/Shadycreek-Run.md) before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) for a cure.
[Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md)  used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items (see “Stone Chest” below). Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to [Irven Liel](./NPCs/Irven-Liel.md), a human merchant staying at the Jolly Dwarf inn in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) while traveling with his family to Uthodurn.

### Stone Chest
The stone chest’s outer lid is carved with the face of a dragon. A character who examines the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check finds pin-sized openings in the dragon’s mouth that contain a blue powder. The powder can be removed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A character who fails this check must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) (see the “Eiselcross” section of chapter 3 of Explorer's Guide to Wildemount).

A detect magic spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of evocation magic. When a creature touches the chest without speaking a prayer to Tiamat, a gust of wind escapes the dragon’s mouth. If the blue powder is still in the dragon’s mouth, it forms a cloud that fills a 15-foot cube in front of the chest. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md).

### Treasure
The chest contains the rest of the treasure found by [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)—a gilded scroll case covered in a cosmological map of the multiverse (worth 15 gp), a jade statuette of a storm giant (25 gp), a quiver containing six +1 arrows, and a silver ring set with a jasper stone (50 gp). It also holds [Hulil’s](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) wealth—415 cp, 234 sp, 43 ep, and 112 gp—and a receipt indicating that [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) sold a blue glass vial to [Irven Liel](./NPCs/Irven-Liel.md) for 100 gp.
