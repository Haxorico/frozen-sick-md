The Glassblades are the soldiers and guards of Uthodurn and its outpost of Palebank Village. The military force of the city has been called the Glassblades since its founding around 35 PD, and it takes its name from signature weapons that resemble jagged glass.

# Description

The Glassblades is the military and ranger force of Uthodurn and performs various soldiering, guarding, scouting, and hunting duties around the city. They are well-trained and enforce the laws of the two small councils of the Diarchy of Uthodurn. The group is named for its signature weapon, which resembles jagged glass but is not actually made of glass.[1][2]

The group is based out of the above-ground Glassblade Kaserne at the mouth of the city, centered around the tunnels leading into the Volition Disc. The Kaserne also contains barracks, training grounds, and storage facilities.[2][3] Members are concentrated toward the entrance of the city and highly defensible areas, but they also patrol the streets.[4]

Palebank Village, an outpost of Uthodurn, is also protected from monsters by generally sixty to ninety "errant" Glassblades under the command of Palebank's leader Elro Aldataur.[5] These Glassblades also own and operate a sailing ship called the Remorhaz that travels to and from Syrinlya.[6] They train and barrack in the Nowhere's Quarter, which includes an open area cleared of snow for training and to set up weapon and armor racks, archery stations, and training dummies.[7]

The Glassblades in Uthodurn wear armor with a dull gray-gold motif with the symbol of the Diarchy across the front. They also wear capes, heavy fur ones if outside and lighter ones if underground.[4][1] Members posted at Palebank do not wear a uniform but are identified by specific colors, pins, and patterns that they wear.[7]

# History
The military force of Uthodurn was called the Glassblades since the city was first founded around 35 PD.[1] A force of them was also established in Palebank Village (founded around 775 PD) at some point before 835 PD.[5]

The Glassblades patrolling the main gate to Uthodurn scared off a pack of wolves chasing the Mighty Nein into the entrance. Senior Glassblade Birrat then stopped the Nein and asked their business in the city. He allowed them through after learning they were seeking Dulgrim Smeltborne and inspecting each of them individually.[1] The Nein and Reani later sought Fen at the barracks as she trained other Glassblades to ask about Gelidon and quickly left after Reani and Fen argued about Reani's safety.[3]

Chetney Pock O'Pea was chased out of Uthodurn by the Glassblades following a violent confrontation with Oltgar at least some months before Campaign 3, set in 843 PD.[8]

Following the apogee solstice, which led to the mass dispelling of enchantments within Uthodurn, the Glassblades patrolled in increased numbers in order to keep the peace.[9] A number of them also were involved in the evacuation of the Grand Disc after Umudara, thought to be a statue, came to life.[10]
