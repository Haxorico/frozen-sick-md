# Traveling to Eiselcross

## Intro (C1)

When the characters are ready to leave for [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md), [Elro Aldataur](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) provides them with the following information:

- [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) has arranged passage to [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) for the characters on the Remorhaz, a sailing ship owned and operated by the [Glassblades](./Factions/Glassblades.md).

- The characters will be taken to [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md), an Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, [Eiselcross’s](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) largest island. Once there, they should talk to a dwarf named [Orvo Mustave](./NPCs/Orvo-Mustave.md), who has gone on numerous expeditions into the wilds of [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) with [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md).

- Once the characters have found the cure, they should use whatever they need for themselves, then give the rest to an elf in [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md) who goes by the name “[the Buyer](./NPCs/The-Buyer.md)”. They can tell [the Buyer](./NPCs/The-Buyer.md) to teleport the cure to [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md).

- The islands of [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) are covered in ice and snow, and are always well below freezing. Characters who don’t already have cold weather gear will want to purchase it, or they will be subject to extreme cold

## Voyage of the Remorhaz (C2)

It takes the Remorhaz nine days to get to [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md). This trip could be uneventful, or you could populate the ship with interesting NPCs and have the characters encounter ocean monsters, Revelry pirates, or severe weather.

When the ship reaches [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md), read:

> The temperature has steadily dropped since you left [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), yet it seems to grow colder still as you step off the ramp of the Remorhaz. Through windy snow, you can see fur-lined tents and yurts arranged in a large camp. Campfires are whipped by the wind, with dwarves and elves huddled close to the flames.

“Don’t worry! It’ll cool down here eventually!” a joking voice bellows over the snow. A female dwarf with a shaggy mane of unkempt hair bows to you. “[Morgo Delwur](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) at your service. Welcome to [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md)!”

[Morgo Delwur](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) (a neutral good, female mountain dwarf werebear) has lived in [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md) for years. She can show the characters around and answer any questions they have about the settlement, providing any of the details found in chapter 3 of Explorer's Guide to Wildemount. If the characters ask about [Orvo Mustave](./NPCs/Orvo-Mustave.md) or [the Buyer](./NPCs/The-Buyer.md), [Morgo](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) points out where both live. Though [Morgo](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) never adventured with [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) and wasn’t a close friend, she is sad to hear of the dwarf’s passing.

[Morgo](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) and the other explorers in [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md) know about [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) and the disease’s terrible effects. If the characters have any unanswered questions about the disease, the explorers share what they know.

As Morgo leads the characters through Syrinlya, read:

> Morgo gestures to the groups of dwarves and elves huddled and chatting around campfires. “They’re planning expeditions to find Aeor’s lost treasures,” she says. “That’s what this whole place is about. If you ain’t exploring, you ain’t banking gold.”

The dwarf stops in front of a large fur-lined yurt. “You can stay here. Belonged to a fool rich elf named Bertron who came here looking for adventure. He found the inside of a saber-toothed tiger instead. Should be some food and the like in there. It’s yours now.”

Once the characters are settled, [Morgo](./NPCs/Morgo-Delwur.md) wishes them luck and leaves to prepare for an expedition of her own (see the “Can You Help Us?” sidebar).

### Can you help us?

If the characters feel as though they need help traveling the wilds of Foren, they can try to convince other explorers in [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md) to travel with them to recover the cure. Although most of [Syrinlya's](./Locations/Syrinlya.md) explorers are willing to help others in need, those explorers already have an important mission. An expedition led by Professor Gulrim Shalebrow (see “The Diarchy of Uthodurn” in chapter 2 of Explorer's Guide to Wildemount) went to search for the origin of the strange magic in the region of Mutalos months ago and has not returned. The explorers at the camp are preparing a search and rescue mission to bring back Gulrim’s party. If the characters survive their quest into Salsvault, this story could serve as a hook for another adventure.

## Into the Wilds (C3)

### Development

After speaking with [Orvo](./NPCs/Orvo-Mustave.md), the characters can make whatever preparations they need before heading into the wilds of [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md). If they wish to obtain more supplies before setting out, there are no shops in [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md), but many of the explorers at the camp are willing to trade goods and equipment.

### Traveling

The characters must travel two hundred miles over ice and snow to reach [Salsvault](./Locations/Salsvault.md). It’s up to the characters whether they want to move at a fast, medium, or slow pace (see “Movement” in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook). If any character has a walking speed of less than 25 feet because of a [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) infection, use the Reduced Travel Speeds table to determine how far the party can travel in a day.

| Slowest Character Speed | Slow Pace | Medium Pace | Fast Pace |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 15–20 ft.               | 12 miles  | 18 miles    | 24 miles  |
| 5–10 ft.                | 6 miles   | 12 miles    | 18 miles  |

As the characters travel, use the Encounters in Eiselcross section to generate random encounters.

- The characters encounter 1d4 wildfolk scouts hunting a saber-toothed tiger. The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition.

- The characters encounter a lost Cerberus Assembly mage trying to return to Balenpost. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of Aeor, and there is a 50 percent chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item.

- The characters find a griffon with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next 1d10 days.

- The characters encounter the revenant of a dead explorer from Balenpost who was murdered by one of its team and is looking for vengeance.

- The characters find a 3-foot-tall, 50-pound egg. If they keep the egg in a cold environment for 1d10 weeks, a white dragon wyrmling hatches from it.

- A young remorhaz ambushes the characters.

#### Finding Salsvault

After traveling forty miles, the characters enter Thin Sheets. This region is known for its large patches of thin ice over deep, frigid water (see the rules for frigid water and thin ice in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

When the characters have traveled two hundred miles, one character who acts as a scout for the group should make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check each day. On a failure, the character finds no signs of [Salsvault](./Locations/Salsvault.md). On a success, the character finds the trail of an [ice mephit](./Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md), which leads to [Salsvault](./Locations/Salsvault.md) after a journey of 1d4 hours. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character finds [Salsvault](./Locations/Salsvault.md) directly.
