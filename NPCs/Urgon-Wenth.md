  Urgon Wenth, a dwarf explorer, recently returned home to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md) after exploring the icy wastes of [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eislecross.md) for a year. The dwarf brought home several items plundered from ruins on Foren, the largest of Eiselcross’s islands. Among these treasures were two beautiful blue glass vials, which Urgon sold to an elf collector named [Verla Pelc](./Verla-Pelc.md). The vials were then stolen, given to a fence out of Shadycreek Run, and sold again to an unsuspecting merchant.
