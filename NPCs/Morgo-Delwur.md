- female mountain dwarfwerebear
- neutral good 
- has lived in [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) for years. 
- She can show the characters around and answer any questions they have about the settlement, providing any of the details found in chapter 3 of Explorer's Guide to Wildemount. If the characters ask about [Orvo Mustave](./Orvo-Mustave.md) or [the Buyer](./The-Buyer.md), Morgo points out where both live. Though Morgo never adventured with [Urgon Wenth](./Urgon-Wenth.md) and wasn’t a close friend, she is sad to hear of the dwarf’s passing.
