Name: Tulgi Lutan
Race: Mountain Dwarf
Age:
Sex: Female
Occupation: Trapper / Thug
TL;DR:

- The female dwarf who was sick after [Urgon-Went](./Urgon-Wenth.md)
- Sister of [Hulil Lutan](./Hulil-Lutan.md)
- Robbed [Urgon's](./Urgon-Wenth.md) teasure from [Pelcs Curiosities](../Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md)
- Dying of [Frigid Woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md)

Descriptions:

- [B1](../B-Mystery-in-Palebank-Village.md):
  > a dwarf trapper, showing signs of the same illness.
- [B4](../B-Mystery-in-Palebank-Village.md):

  - A neutral evil, female mountain dwarf thug with a walking speed of 10 feet
  - Gruff and to the point, and tries to compensate for her illness with bluster. If the characters entered the cabin with her permission or if she surrenders to them, she tells them only that she has the same affliction that killed [Urgon](./Urgon-Wenth.md), and that she’s looking for a cure.
  - A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check convinces her to reveal the following information:

    - she came to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md) a few years back from Shadycreek Run with her sister, [Hulil](./Hulil-Lutan.md). Both work for the Uttolot family.
    - The [Uttolots](../Factions/Uttolots.md) sent the sisters and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md)—with the intent of stealing them. When such artifacts come through the small settlement, they are often unusual goods that treasure hunters are trying to keep away from Uthodurn or the Dwendalian Empire.
    - When [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) returned to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md) with treasures from [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md), Tulgi saw her chance. She waited for [Urgon](./Urgon-Wenth.md) to sell his finds to [Pelc’s Curiosities](../Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md), then stole them all.
    - She gave most of [Urgon](./Urgon-Wenth.md)’s relics to Hulil, but kept one for herself—an ornate dagger. She grudgingly gives this weapon to the characters if asked (see “Treasure” below). [Hulil](./Hulil-Lutan.md) has the other items in a site north of the village known as [Croaker Cave](../Locations/Croaker-Cave.md).
    - She was the one who searched [Urgon](./Urgon-Wenth.md)’s cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.
      Loot:
      If Tulgi doesn’t offer her dagger to the characters, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher notices the ornate blade in a gilded sheath tucked under her shirt. If the characters claim the +1 dagger, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check reveals that the dagger is a relic of the fallen flying city of Aeor.
