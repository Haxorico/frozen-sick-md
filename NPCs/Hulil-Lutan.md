- Believes she has a disease called [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md). Though she doesn’t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she’s heard rumors that explorers in [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md) sometimes succumb to it.
- Has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials [Tulgi](./Tulgi-Lutan.md) stole from [Pelc’s Curiosities](../Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md), originally sold by [Urgon Wenth](./Urgon-Wenth.md). The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely color was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior.
She is desperate to get to [Shadycreek Run](../Locations/Shadycreek-Run.md) before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by [Tulgi](./Tulgi-Lutan.md) for a cure.
Hulil used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items. Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to [Irven Liel](./Irven-Liel.md)
