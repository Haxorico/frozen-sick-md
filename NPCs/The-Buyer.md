- lawful neutral, male, high elf mage
- Lives in [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md)
- Can teleport the cure directly to [Elro](./Elro-Aldataur.md)
- [Morgo Delwur](./Morgo-Delwur.md) or any other resident of [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) can point out the Buyer’s hut to the characters. 
- Lives in [Syrinlya’s](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) largest yurt. 


When the characters enter, read:
> The pungent scent of incense fills this yurt, whose walls are painted with glowing arcane runes. A brass brazier burns brightly at the center of the floor, around which are set a few plush chairs, a bed, and a large stone chest. On one of those chairs sits an elf reading a book. A small dragon with green butterfly wings is curled in the elf’s lap.


The Buyer is a mysterious elf who purchases Aeorian relics in [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) for the Uthodurnian government. (See the “Syrinlya” section of chapter 3 of Explorer's Guide to Wildemount for more information about the Buyer and their business. The green faerie dragon is Dew, the elf’s familiar.)

The Buyer has been in [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) since the day the outpost was founded. He can answer any questions the characters might have about the outpost’s history, the island of Foren, or [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md). If the characters want to confirm that the Buyer is able to quickly send the cure for [frigid woe](../Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md), the elf tells them that the stone chest in the yurt has the magical capability to teleport objects on command.

In addition to the aid he provides in getting the cure back to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md), the Buyer offers to purchase any Aeorian relics the characters want to sell.

## Stone Chest

A detect magic spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of conjuration magic. When an item is placed in the chest, the Buyer can teleport it to secret locations in Uthodurn or its outpost of [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md), with those locations known only to the authorities of those settlements.
