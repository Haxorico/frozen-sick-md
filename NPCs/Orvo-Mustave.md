# [Traveling to Eiselcross](../C-Traveling-to-Eiselcross.md) ([C1])

- a chaotic good, male mountain dwarf scout
- curious and soft-spoken explorer
- Has gone on numerous expeditions into the wilds of [Eiselcross](./Eiselcross.md) with [Urgon Wenth](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md).
- [Morgo Delwur](./Morgo-Delwur.md) or any other resident of [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md) can point out Orvo Mustave’s tent to the characters.

When the characters approach the tent, read:

> A campfire burns in front of this small tent, whose flaps are open. Inside the tent sits a young dwarf whose face is scarred as though scratched by a large claw. A shortsword is casually laid across his lap as he warms his outstretched hands.

Orvo Mustave enjoys uncovering the secrets of [Eiselcross](../Locations/Eiselcross.md) as much as he does uncovering the region’s treasures. He is genuinely interested in the characters’ lives, and asks them lots of questions after inviting them to share his fire.

## Orvo's Story

Orvo is grief-stricken to hear about the demise of his friend [Urgon Wenth](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md). If the characters ask Orvo about the blue vials that brought disease to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md), Orvo shares the following information:

- Orvo and [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) found the blue vials in [Salsvault](../Locations/Salsvault.md), an Aeorian ruin partially submerged in water in a region of Foren where the glacial ice is thin. Explorers call this region Thin Sheets. Orvo believes the ruin is as well preserved as it is because the structure was reinforced with magic, as were many of Aeor’s buildings that housed hazardous materials or secret projects.

- [Salsvault](../Locations/Salsvault.md) is two hundred miles northwest of [Syrinlya](../Locations/Syrinlya.md). [Ice mephits](../Monsters/Ice-Mephit.md) are drawn to the magic of something at that location. Orvo and [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) found the ruin after following one of the creatures.

- [Salsvault](../Locations/Salsvault.md) appears to have been an Aeorian lab. Orvo and [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) explored only three of its chambers before being chased away by animated suits of armor.

- The dwarves didn’t know what the vials contained.

- Orvo sold his share of the treasure from [Salsvault](../Locations/Salsvault.md) to the Buyer. [Urgon](../NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) decided to hang onto his share until he returned home to [Palebank Village](../Locations/Planebank-Village.md).
