# About (A1)
Something is killing people in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), and if the characters don’t stop it, they might be next. “Frozen Sick” is an adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level and introduces them to the continent’s Biting North region—the bleak arctic realms of the Greying Wildlands and Eiselcross.

If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see chapter 4 in the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount), work with them to decide how they made their way to [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md). Are they citizens of Uthodurn now aiding in the surface expansion of their civilization? Have they come north to seek freedom from the wars of other lands? Any number of options can help tie characters to this frigid region and the mysteries it holds.

# Story Overview (A2)

[Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md), a dwarf explorer, recently returned home to [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) after exploring the icy wastes of [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eislecross.md) for a year. The dwarf brought home several items plundered from ruins on Foren, the largest of [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md)’s islands. Among these treasures were two beautiful blue glass vials, which [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) sold to an elf collector named [Verla Pelc](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md). The vials were then stolen, given to a fence out of Shadycreek Run, and sold again to an unsuspecting merchant.

In truth, the vials’ beautiful blue color is the result of deadly blue spores that cling to the interior of the glass. Faint cracks in both the vials have exposed each person who handled them to [Frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md), a deadly disease that can’t be cured by conventional means. The disease has already killed [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) and [Verla](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md), turning them into ice statues. 


## Adventure Summary (A3)

While the characters are in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), community leader [Elro Aldataur](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) asks for their help figuring out who or what has killed [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md). An explorer recently returned from [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md), [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) was afflicted by a strange malady that turned him into an ice statue, and which has since shown up in another of the village’s residents. The characters investigate the mystery while contending with the forces of the [Uttolots](./Factions/Uttolots.md), one of the criminal families that control [Shadycreek Run](./Locations/Shadycreek-Run.md). More infected locals are discovered, including one more already dead, before the characters clear [Uttolot thugs](./Factions/Uttolots.md) out of a local cavern complex called [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md). In the end, the vials of [Frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) are reclaimed, but merchant [Irven Liel](./NPCs/Irven-Liel.md) and his family are infected and will be the next to die without a cure. Moreover, the characters might well be infected with the disease themselves.

[Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) asks the characters to travel to [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) to seek a cure for [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md). The characters take a boat to [Syrinlya](./Locations/Syrinlya.md), the Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, and retrace [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s path to the ruin of Salsvault. This magic laboratory was once a part of Aeor, an ancient flying city-state that crashed into [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) during the Calamity. Only by braving Salsvault’s defenses and deadly guardians can the adventurers find the antidote they need.

## Setup and Starting Points (A4)

Work with the players to establish why their characters are in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md). You can provide information regarding the village and its surrounding lands.
