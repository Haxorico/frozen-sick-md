# Mystery in Palebank Village (B)

The adventure begins in [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), with the characters drawn immediately into the drama of death in an isolated settlement. Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

> Snow gently falls from the sky and wind bites your cheeks as you stand in the graveyard of [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), a fishing outpost of Uthodurn that is home to several hundred dwarves and elves. The sun is low in the sky, sinking behind the fresh grave of [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md), an old dwarf who caught a curse or disease that turned him into an ice statue. The folk of the village have gathered to pay their final respects to [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s frozen remains.

> A gruff voice speaks softly from behind you. “Thank you for attending [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s service.” You turn and meet the gaze of [Elro Aldataur](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md), a weathered elf, retired ranger, and the leader of the village. “I’m sorry to speak of dark tidings under such circumstances, but I believe that [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) might be in danger, and I’m hoping you can help us.”

> השלג יורד. אתם עובדים בבית הקברות של כפר פייל-בנק, מוצב דיג של אות'ודורן שביתיהם של כמה מאות גמדים ואלפים. השמש נמוכה בשמיים, שוקעת מאחורי קברו הטרי של אורגון ונט', גמד זקן שלכד קללה או מחלה שהפכה אותו לפסל קרח. תושבי הכפר התאספו כדי לחלוק את כבודם האחרון לשרידיו הקפואים של אורגון.

> קול נשמע מאחורייכם. "תודה לכם שהגעת להלווייתו של אורגון." אתם מסתובבים ופוגשים את מבטו של אלרו אלדאטאור, אלף, צייד בגמלאות ומנהיג הכפר. "אני מצטער לדבר על בשורות קשות בנסיבות כאלה, אבל אני מאמין שכפר פייל-בנק עשוי להיות בסכנה, ואני מקווה שתוכלו לעזור לנו."

Whether the characters are known in the village as neophyte adventurers or simply look the part, [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) (a neutral good, male wood elf veteran) hopes that they’re the sort of people not afraid to step up to help folks in need. Use the following points to help guide the conversation as he explains his concerns to the characters:

- Two months ago, [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) returned home after exploring [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) for a year. He had been back for only for a few days when he came down with a strange affliction, which made the dwarf move slowly and caused blue veins to appear all over his body.
- The village’s priests of Moradin and Corellon used every spell they could muster to attempt to heal [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md), but nothing they tried could stop the bizarre malady. [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) battled the affliction for weeks, until his ever-slowing body eventually turned to ice.
- Until yesterday, [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) and the rest of the community believed that [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s sad fate was an isolated incident, most likely caused by something the dwarf came into contact with while exploring [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md). Then [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) noticed [Tulgi Lutan](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md), a dwarf trapper, showing signs of the same illness.
- Alarmed, [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) tried to talk to [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) about it, but she pushed him away, asking that he let her die in peace.

## Elro’s Request (B2)

If the characters are willing, [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) wants them to find out what caused [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) and [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md)’s affliction. He’s worried that it could spread, but [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) refuses to talk to him, and the [Glassblades](./Factions/Glassblades.md) in the village are better known for their combat skills than their ability to glean the truth in a complicated situation. Moreover, [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) is extremely distrustful of the authorities.

[Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) thinks a group of adventurers might have better luck convincing [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) to talk. If the characters agree to help find the cause of [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) and [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md)’s affliction, [Elro](./NPCs/Elro-Aldataur.md) offers to pay them 100 gp. He suggests that the characters start by searching [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s home or talking to [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) at her cabin.

## Urgon's Cabin (B3)

[Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) lived in a one-story, one-room log cabin at the edge of town. A good-natured [Glassblade](./Factions/Glassblades.md) rookie named [Mila Teno](./NPCs/Mila-Teno.md) (a lawful good, female wood elf scout) stands guard outside the front door. If the characters explain why they’ve come, she allows them to enter the house and look around. When the characters enter the [cabin](./Locations//Urgon-Cabin.md), read:

> This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns. On the other side of the room, a small table strewn with dirty dishes and set with a dwarf-sized chair stands before two empty shelves whose contents are scattered across the floor: kitchen utensils, dried foodstuffs, adventuring gear, and a few books.

Any character who examines the mess in the cabin realizes that someone recently trashed the place while searching it. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the intruder’s footprints. [Tulgi Lutan](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) was the culprit, desperate for any clues that might help her cure the [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) that is killing her. Her tracks lead outside and back to her [cabin](./Locations/Tulgi-Cabin.md)

### Adventuring Equipment

[Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s adventuring equipment consists of: 
- a silvered maul
- a suit of splint armor sized for a dwarf
- bulky, fur-lined clothing sized for a dwarf
- a grappling hook
- a hooded lantern.

### Mounted Head

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes that the head mounted above the mantle belonged to a yeti, a monstrosity found in [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md).

### Strange Receipt

A character who searches through the books on the shelf and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a folded receipt used as a bookmark. The receipt is dated two months previous, and indicates that [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) sold several Aeorian items found in [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md) to local antique shop [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) for 1,000 gp. The items are listed as a dagger, a scroll case, a jade statuette, a quiver of twenty arrows, a silver ring set with a jasper, and two blue glass vials.

Characters who are residents of [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) or have been there for a while know of [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md)—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago.

### Development

After searching the cabin, the characters can continue their investigation by going to [Tulgi’s cabin](./Locations/Tulgi-Cabin.md) or by stopping at [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) (assuming they found the receipt).

## Tulgi's Cabin (B4)

When the characters approach [Tulgi’s cabin](./Locations/Tulgi-Cabin.md), read:

> This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke piping out of the chimney indicates a roaring fire within.

[Tulgi Lutan](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md)’s home is a one-story, one-room log cabin. Because she isn’t keen on letting the characters in, the following features might be important:

- The roof of the cabin is 12 feet high. Climbing up the outside walls requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
- The wooden door to the cabin is locked and has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) carries the key that unlocks the door.
- Each of the cabin’s four walls has one window, which is shuttered and latched from the inside. A window can be unlatched from outside with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
- The inside of the cabin is brightly lit by fires in a brazier and a fireplace, though the smoky haze given off by both makes the interior lightly obscured.

If the characters knock on the door, [Tulgi Lutan](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf thug with a walking speed of 10 feet) calls from the other side, telling them to go away. A character who shouts back through the door and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check convinces [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) to open the door and allow the party inside. Otherwise, she ignores anything the characters say.

If the characters aren’t invited inside, they’ll have to decide what other means they’re willing to use to enter. Regardless of how they do so, when the characters enter the cabin, read:

> The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze. Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands.

If the characters broke into the cabin, [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) attacks as soon as she sees them, fighting until reduced to 10 hit points, then surrendering. She has two pet [wolves](./Monsters/Wolf.md), Iro and Jira, that hide beneath her bed. If a fight breaks out, the [wolves](./Monsters/Wolf.md) join the fray to defend her.

### Fire Hazards

Any creature that comes into contact with the brazier or the fireplace for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there, takes 2d4 fire damage.

### What Tulgi Knows

[Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) is gruff and to the point, and tries to compensate for her illness with bluster. If the characters entered the cabin with her permission or if she surrenders to them, she tells them only that she has the same affliction that killed [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md), and that she’s looking for a cure.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check convinces [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) to reveal the following information:

[Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) came to [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) a few years back from Shadycreek Run with her sister, [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md). Both work for the [Uttolot family](./Factions/Uttolots.md).
The [Uttolots](./Factions/Uttolots.md) sent the sisters and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md)—with the intent of stealing them. When such artifacts come through the small settlement, they are often unusual goods that treasure hunters are trying to keep away from Uthodurn or the Dwendalian Empire.
When [Urgon Wenth](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) returned to [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) with treasures from [Eiselcross](./Locations/Eiselcross.md), [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) saw her chance. She waited for [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) to sell his finds to [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md), then stole them all.
[Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) gave most of [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s relics to [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md), but kept one for herself—an ornate dagger. She grudgingly gives this weapon to the characters if asked (see “Treasure” below). [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) has the other items in a site north of the village known as [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md).
[Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) was the one who searched [Urgon](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md)’s cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.

### Treasure

If [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) doesn’t offer her dagger to the characters, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher notices the ornate blade in a gilded sheath tucked under her shirt. If the characters claim the +1 dagger, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check reveals that the dagger is a relic of the fallen flying city of Aeor.

### Development

The characters have no trouble finding either [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md) or [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) if either of those locations is their next destination. If things went bad with [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md) and she died before revealing any information, the characters might find notes or instructions from [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) revealing some of the information above.

## Pelc’s Curiosities (B5)

[Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) is an antique shop run by an introverted elf named [Verla Pelc](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md). [Verla](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md) keeps to herself, opening her shop only when the mood strikes her. She trades any and all objects that interest her, shipping them across Wildemount. Characters who are residents of [Palebank Village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md) or have been there for a while know of [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md)—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago. If the characters are recent arrivals to [the village](./Locations/Planebank-Village.md), anyone they ask about the shop mentions the robbery.

[Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) is a one-story, two-room log cabin. The windows are shuttered and locked from inside, leaving the interior dark. The only entrance is the front door, but characters can force open one of the shutters around the back with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, granting access to Verla’s quarters (see that section below).

When the characters approach the cabin, read:

> The dark cabin before you has a sign over its door which reads, “Pelc’s Curiosities,” with the image of a curving dragon used to make the letter P. Though the shop appears closed, the front door is slightly ajar.

Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher hears whispered voices and footsteps coming from inside the cabin. If the characters succeed on a group DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check, they can surprise the bandits currently in the shop.

### Front Shop Area

The antique shop occupies the large front room of the cabin. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> Five [cloaked elves](./Monsters/Bandit.md) appear to have ransacked the shop and are searching through the broken debris on the floor. The furniture, shelves, and front counter have been smashed, and the shop’s wares now litter the floor.

This area is difficult terrain thanks to the debris covering it. The five elves are [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep.

The [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) attack as soon as they notice the characters, fighting until only one remains. That survivor then surrenders. If a captive [bandit](./Monsters/Bandit.md) is questioned, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check can learn the following information:

- The [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) work for [Hulil Lutan](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md), a dwarf priestess of Tiamat. [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) works for the [Uttolot family](./Factions/Uttolots.md) of Shadycreek Run.
- [Hulil's](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) sister, [Tulgi](./NPCs/Tulgi-Lutan.md), robbed [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) two months ago.
- [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) is sick or cursed with some affliction that causes her to move slowly and is turning her veins blue. [(Frigid Woe)](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md)
- [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) ordered the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) to trash [Pelc’s Curiosities](./Locations/Pelcs-Curiosities.md) in search of potions, scrolls, or other items that might help cure her. Despite their thorough search, the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) found nothing useful. [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) is hiding out with more [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) in [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md).

### Verla’s Quarters

[Verla’s](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md) quarters are at the back of the cabin. When the characters gain access to this area, read:

> What appears to be an ice statue of an elf is bundled beneath the blankets of a bed along the east wall of the room. A small table loaded with dirty teacups and a kettle stands next to the bed.

The figure in the bed is the unfortunate [Verla Pelc](./NPCs/Verla-Pelc.md), who was infected with [frigid woe](./Spells/Frigid-Woe.md) by [Urgon Wenth’s](./NPCs/Urgon-Wenth.md) Aeorian relics. Her symptoms appeared a few weeks after the shop was robbed, but the reclusive elf never told anyone about them.

### Development

Questioning any of the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) can turn up solid leads that can take the characters to [Croaker Cave](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md), or back to [Tulgi’s cabin](./Locations/Tulgi-Cabin.md) if there are other questions the dwarf has yet to answer. If they were unable to question the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md), you can have one of the [bandits](./Monsters/Bandit.md) carrying orders from [Hulil](./NPCs/Hulil-Lutan.md) that point toward the [Croaker Cave hideout](./Locations/Croaker-Cave.md).
